# PlasmaLLM

PlasmaLLM is a system-aware AI assistant widget for the KDE Plasma 6 desktop. It provides a native interface to various LLM endpoints, integrating system information gathering, web search, and shell command execution directly into your desktop workflow.

PlasmaLLM is designed for quick tasks and system-integrated workflows—not as a replacement for full-featured chat applications. It excels at answering technical questions about your system, running terminal commands, and providing an agentic interface for desktop automation.

## Features

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Connects to Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenCode Zen/Go, and any OpenAI-compatible API.
- **System Awareness**: Optionally gathers hardware, OS, and environment info to provide context for assistant responses.
- **Tool-Calling System**: Modular architecture allowing LLMs to interact with the filesystem, run shell commands, and fetch web data (with user approval).
- **Interactive Terminal Blocks**: View, copy, or execute suggested terminal commands. Supports session multiplexing via `tmux` or `screen`.
- **Web Search Integration**: Native support for DuckDuckGo and SearXNG.
- **Vision Support**: Supports image attachments for providers with multimodal capabilities (e.g., Gemini).
- **Voice Input (STT)**: Hold-to-talk microphone that transcribes via an OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions` API (e.g. OpenRouter `openai/gpt-transcribe`) or a local OpenAI Whisper CLI, then sends the text to your active chat profile.
- **Secure Storage**: Integrates with KWallet for secure management of API keys and secrets.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Full support for markdown, including syntax highlighting for code blocks and LaTeX for mathematical notation.
- **Context Compaction**: Save tokens and speed up local model processing by reducing the size of the context that needs to process.

## Requirements

- KDE Plasma 6.0+
- Qt 6
- Optional: `python3-matplotlib`, `python3-dbus`, and `python3-gobject` (or distro equivalents) for Mathtext LaTeX rendering
- Optional: `qt6-qtmultimedia` (or distro equivalent) for microphone capture via Qt Multimedia (Voice Input)
- Optional: `pw-record`, `ffmpeg`, or `arecord` as a shell fallback if Qt capture is unavailable (Voice Input)
- Optional: OpenAI Whisper CLI (`whisper` from the `openai-whisper` Python package) for local speech-to-text
- Optional: `tmux` or `screen` for session multiplexing.

### Voice input setup

1. Open **Configure PlasmaLLM → Speech to Text**.
2. Enable **microphone input**.
3. Choose **STT backend**.

#### OpenAI-compatible API

4. Choose a provider (e.g. **OpenRouter**), confirm endpoint `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`.
5. Click **Fetch models** (this queries transcription models — OpenRouter does **not** list them on the normal chat model list).
6. Select a model such as `openai/gpt-transcribe`, save your API key.

#### OpenAI Whisper (local CLI)

4. Select **OpenAI Whisper (local CLI)**.
5. Set **Command** if `whisper` is not on your PATH. The field is a prefix inserted as-is, for example `python3 -m whisper` or `toolbox run whisper`.
6. Choose a model (`base` is the default). The first run may download weights into `~/.cache/whisper`.
7. Optional: task (transcribe/translate), device (`cpu`/`cuda`), FP16, threads, initial prompt, extra CLI args.
8. Use **Test CLI** to confirm the command responds to `--help`. No STT API key is required.

Then, for either backend:

9. **Mic button** mode:
   - **Auto** (default): short click toggles recording; press and hold (~250 ms+) for push-to-talk until release.
   - **Hold to talk**: press-and-hold only.
   - **Toggle**: click to start, click again to stop and send.
10. Optional: set a **Voice shortcut** (default **Ctrl+M**) while the panel is open and focused. It follows the same **Mic button** mode (auto / hold / toggle). Clear the field to disable. To open the panel from elsewhere, use **Activate widget** on the dialog’s Shortcuts page.
11. Your **active chat profile** (General page) is still used for the conversation; STT is only the speech engine.

### OpenCode Go setup

[OpenCode Go](https://opencode.ai/docs/go/) is a first-class provider — pick **OpenCode Go** in **Configure PlasmaLLM → General**, paste the key from [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth), and click **Fetch models**. The endpoint is fixed and the model list loads without a key.

The gateway serves three wire formats from the same key — chat completions, Anthropic-style messages, and the OpenAI Responses API — and each model answers on only one of them. PlasmaLLM routes automatically: Qwen models go to `/messages`, Grok 4.5 and GPT 5.6 Luna to `/responses`, everything else to chat completions. If a model turns out to be routed differently, the request is retried on the remaining formats and the working one is remembered for the session, so the widget keeps up as OpenCode moves models between backends.

A few models on the published list are not reachable in every account: the `deepseek-v4-*` models are China-region hosted and need explicit opt-in on your OpenCode account, while `mimo-v2-pro`, `mimo-v2-omni`, and `hy3-preview` are currently unserved upstream. PlasmaLLM reports each of these with a specific explanation rather than a raw gateway error.

## Installation

### From the KDE Store
You can install PlasmaLLM directly from the Plasma widget explorer:
**Add Widgets** → **Get New Widgets** → **Download New Plasma Widgets** → Search for "PlasmaLLM".

### From GitHub Releases
Download the latest `.plasmoid` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/joshuaeroman/plasmallm/releases) page:

```bash
plasmapkg2 --install PlasmaLLM-*.plasmoid
```

### From Source
## Note: Building code directly from master branch may pull in unreleased features without translations from English. Translations are only done in release prep. Checkout a specific tag first if you'd prefer to build a particular release.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuaeroman/plasmallm.git
cd plasmallm
make install
plasmashell --replace &
```

For development (symlinks the package directory):
```bash
make install-dev
```

## Configuration

Right-click the widget and select **Configure PlasmaLLM...**:

- **General**: Set your provider, model, and API keys. The **Decisions (TypeSafe / Jev)** adapter (TypeSafe direct or OpenRouter) is for decision models: instead of chatting, each message is evaluated once and answered with a verdict and confidence (Yes / No / Uncertain). Decisions profiles have no conversation memory, system prompt, or tools.
- **Appearance**: Configure fonts, bubble styles, and interface behavior.
- **Tools**: Enable/disable specific tools and configure the filesystem whitelist for sandboxed operations. Finished tool results collapse to a small pill by default (per-tool toggle); click to expand. The `run_command` tool can optionally verify each command with a second model profile before it runs (Auto-detect, Jev/TypeSafe structured decisions, or a JSON verdict from any chat profile): the command must match its LLM-supplied justification and be well-written shell (no incomplete constructs or syntax errors). Mismatched or malformed commands are denied automatically; validation errors fall back to asking for approval. Selecting a Decisions profile as the validator is the recommended setup.
- **Tasks**: Manage custom script tools and shell command templates.
- **Skills**: Discover and toggle Agent Skills (`SKILL.md` folders or `<name>.md` files) loaded on demand. PlasmaLLM ships a bundled `create-skill` helper; add your own under `~/.local/share/plasmallm/skills/` or extra directories in Settings. Skills may include `.sh` scripts run via `run_skill_script`; enable “Allow running skill scripts without approval” per skill in Settings. Use `/skills` in chat to list what is available.
